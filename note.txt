to remote GitHub.om repository
Few things happened:
1. it automatically created new remote repo
  under your github.com account
2. made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo

2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this changhe to be reflected in remote repository so we PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button
4.observe it has been added in your repository in GitHub.com
